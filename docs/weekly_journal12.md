Progress Update:
- I tried to establish the improvement in model performance and removal of overfitting by removing the minority class from the dataset.
- The basic model was fitted on the same dataset after removing class 'Other' and its performance was evaluated.
- I discovered that the performance for the basic model improved only slightly on train, test, and validation data.

Challenges Faced: 
- I found it difficult at first to remove the clas 'Other' from the mixed dataset. However, I was able to come up with a code for that.

Next Steps: I aim to fit the advanced model on the dataset without 'Other' class.
