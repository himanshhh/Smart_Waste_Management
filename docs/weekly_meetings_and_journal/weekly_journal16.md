Progress Update:
- Since last week, fine-tunin ResNet50 did not help remove the confusion between classes and downgraded the performance of waste classification model, this week the focus was on finding a different model and performing fine tuned transfer learning.
- Looking at the literature review and online research, it was decided that the efficientNetb0 model should be tested while performing transfer learning for classification tasks.
- The work involved exploring the model architecture and executing fine-tuned transfer learning using this pre-trained model.
- Another crucial aspect was comparing the results of this model with MobileNetV2 performance.

Challenges Faced: 
- Identifying the nth layer to unfreeze and train on the given dataset.
- Training time was high.
- It was difficult to find in-depth literature and references for waste classification using efficientnetb0 transfer learning.
- The model was not able to eradicate confusion between classes and gave a performance metrics worse than MobileNetV2.

Next Steps: Try to find another model that gives better or comparable results as MobileNetV2.
