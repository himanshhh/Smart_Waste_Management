Progress Update:
- Testing the best models by uploading a single image and checking confidence score for the classification result.
- The models tested were MobileNetV2, InceptionV3, and Best Model from scratch.
- Performed comparison based on testing and evaluation metrics acquired throughout the previous weeks.
- Future Steps explained.

CONCLUSION: 
- Although InceptionV3 seems to do best in testing with a confidence score of 100%, it is evident from the evaluation metrics that MobileNEtV2 handles class confusion better , with good evaulation metrics scores, and is also time-efficient.
- The best model gives a satisfactory testing performance, but is not proven to be as good as MobileNetV2.
- MobileNetV2 gives the best testing and evaluation metrics results.

Future Steps:
- Improve model precison through better preprocessing, more hyperparameter tuning, and exploring better transfer learning models.
- User-interface for deployment of the model for general use.
