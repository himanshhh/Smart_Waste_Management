Progress Update:
- The ResNet50 model was explored and found to be a deep layered model. 
- A similar process of transfer learning with fine-tuning was applied and the results were compared with the previous models in terms of precision, recall, mAP, and accuracy.
- It was found that the ResNet50 model performed worse than the MobileNetV2 model.

Challenges Faced: 
- It was a rigorous task to explore the ResNet50 model and decide which layer to select for fine-tuning. 
- The results obtained were poor when only transfer learning was applied.
- The results improved slightly after the application of fine-tuning.
- However, the confusion between classes was not improved.

Next Steps: Fit more pre-trained models using Transfer Learning and fine-tuning for our given task of waste classification.  The results will be compared based on MAP, precision, recall and accuracy.
