Progress Update:
- I fitted the advanced model on the dataset without 'Other' class.
- I observed that the validation, train, and test accuracy improved slightly.
- The bigger observation was the removal of overfitting which was initially problematic.

Challenges Faced: 
- The accuracy is still only satisfactory. However, it has already been established from the week before last week that better performance is achievable.

Next Steps: Perform Transfer Learning and test pre-trained models
