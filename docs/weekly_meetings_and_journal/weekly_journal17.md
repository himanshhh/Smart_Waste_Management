Progress Update:
- This week, the InceptionV3 architecture was explored and executed for fine-tuning and transfer learning for the waste classification task.
- The top layers were unfrozen to train with the given dataset.
- The evaluation metrics was calculated and compared.
- This model was able to give comparable results to mobilenetv2 and outperformed resnet50, and efficientnetb0.
- The class confusion was also reduced.

Challenges Faced: 
- It was challenging to find a model that gave better results than ResNet50, and EfficientNetB0.
- Although the model gave comparable results to MobileNetV2, the training time was high, and the class confusion did not reduce significantly.
- The evaluation metrics gave better outcome than the online reference, however, precision score did not improve.

Next Steps: Next week is for testing the best models obtained through the previous weeks. These models include MobilneNetV2, InceptionV3, and best model from scratch.
