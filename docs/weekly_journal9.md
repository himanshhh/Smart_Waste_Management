Progress Update:
- built, trained and tested advanced model
- generated model accuracy and loss
- made progress with the interim report

Challenges Faced: 
- accuracy of the advanced model decreases down to 70%
- possibly overfitting as the training accuracy is much higher than the validation accuracy

Next Steps: explore the models deeper to overcome overfitting, try hyperparameter tuning
