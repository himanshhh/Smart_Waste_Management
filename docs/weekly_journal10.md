Progress Update:
- performed hyperparamter tuning
- applied stratified k-fold cross validation
- test evaluation metrices like precision, recall, and mAP

Challenges Faced: 
- While we get mAP, and recall scores slightly similar to the ones on the official dataset website, the precision score is comparatively low.
- Training the model on a grid of multiple hyperparameters is an exhaustive and time-consuming process.

Next Steps: explore the best model
