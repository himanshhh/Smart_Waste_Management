Smart Waste Management with Deep Learning

## Description
This project is designed to create a smart waste management system. It takes images of different waste items and categorizes them as recyclable or non-recyclable waste. This is done by utilizing a deep learning model that is trained on historical image data that is clearly annotated. The model learns to classify these objects based on the annotations. The project aims to achieve high accuracy in identifying unseen objects and sorting them into their respective waste categories.
